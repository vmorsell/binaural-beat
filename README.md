## What is a binaural beat?

Definition from [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/binaural-beats):

> When two tones of slightly different frequencies are played in separate ears simultaneously (usually through headphones), the human brain perceives the creation of a new, third tone, whose frequency is equivalent to the difference between the two tones being played. This auditory illusion is called a binaural beat. For example, if a person hears a tone of 405 Hz in one ear and a tone of 415 Hz in the other, they would be hearing a binaural beat with a frequency of 10 Hz.
>
> Binaural beats are said to provide many of the same benefits as meditation: lower stress, increase focus, aid with sleep and relaxation, boost mood, assist with pain management, and foster creativity. However, these claims are not yet supported by scientific evidence.

## Is it bogus?
